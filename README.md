On-the-Job Ticket: Accessibility
Take Existing Code and Refactor it
(to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does)

    User Story
    AS A marketing agency
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

    Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Edits Made
Accessibility changes, fixes, and general organization

    Added code notes to HTML and CSS
    HTML Semantic Elements Added: header, nav, section, footer
    Added alt statements to HTML images
    Added id="search-engine-optimization" so nav to it would work
    Removed segmented Horiseon header for accessibility (site readers)
    Moved heart emoji in footer to front of the text and put love in it's only place for accessibility (site readers)
    Rearranged CSS to keep CSS for each section together
